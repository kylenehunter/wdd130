    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Spanish Fork, Utah. My family and I moved here when I was a freshman in college. It has many
        places to hike and go walking. It is also close enough to college so my brothers and I could continue higher
        education while still being close to family.</p>
