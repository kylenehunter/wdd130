        <p>I live in Spanish Fork, Utah. I love to do arts and crafts, including crocheting, drawing, and beading. My
            favorite color is purple, and I have two brothers and one sister.</p>

        <p>Utah is one of the 50 states of the United States of America. The state capital is Salt Lake City, which is
            also the location of the Salt Lake Temple. The temple is currently going through rennovations, but it will
            have an open house in 2027. Another building in Salt Lake City is the Conference Center where this picture
            was taken.</p>
