            <p>My name is Kylene Hunter. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of
                Latter-day Saints. I live in Spanish Fork, Utah. I was born in Provo, Utah, though sometime after that
                my
                family moved to California where I lived until I was in 3rd grade. We moved back to Utah and lived in
                Stansbury Park for 9 years before we moved to Spanish Fork Utah, where we have lived ever since then. My
                favorite hobby is arts and crafts. I've been drawing ever since I was little kid, I
                learned to crochet while I was in Young Womens, and I learned beading sometime after that.
                my favorite color is purple, and I have two brothers and one sister. I enjoy going on hikes with my
                family.
                I'm currently working as a grocery stocker, which I enjoy because I am organizing and refilling shelves
                with
                products that people buy. I became a student at BYU Pathway because while I enjoy my job, I also want to
                look for something I would want to do long-term that can allow me to support myself when needed.
            </p>

            <p>Utah is one of the 50 states of the United States of America. The state capital is Salt Lake City, which
                is
                also the location of the Salt Lake Temple. The temple is currently going through rennovations, but it
                will
                have an open house in 2027. Another building in Salt Lake City is the Conference Center where this
                picture
                was taken.</p>
