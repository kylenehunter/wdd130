        <p>Forest Flow: This calm, luxurious location provides an environment of thick trees where people can enjoy
          their surroundings. Our
          trainers will make sure the rafts are kept
          at a safe distance from any wild animals spotted, including bear and moose. Warning: If anyone is caught
          violating the rules the
          supervisor
          imposes, the trip will be cancelled for that
          person, and they will immediately be
          taken back to camp.</p>

        <p>Mount Cruise: This river trip combines scenic views with moments of riding waves and rapids. Mountain goats
          have been known to be spotted in this area. Children
          around 8 year old are allowed as long as they are secured inside the raft. As with all rafting events, the
          supervisor and trainer will
          review the rules to make sure everyone feels safe.</p>

      <article>
        <p>Water Jump: This rafting river is for those looking for a more daring trip with their friends and family.
          Here
          you will ride rapids in Weber Utah and jump literal waterfalls. Extra training will be required prior to
          actually jumping the waterfalls. Our trainers will make sure each member feels comfortable and ready
          before attempting to jump the waterfall as a group. This river is for ages 16 and up only, though parents
          should decide if they want their teenagers riding this.</p>
